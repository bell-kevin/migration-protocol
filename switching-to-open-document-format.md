### Switching to Open Document Format

It is also important to switch immediately to the standard ODF format for all documents, and resort to legacy or current MS Office document formats only to exchange files with users of the proprietary office suite. File sharing is a crucial issue, because it is essential to be able to develop and exchange information effectively. Using ODF as the default document format helps organizations to establish a repository for all information assets, guaranteed against obsolescence and vendor lock-in.

In addition, MS Office is able to read and write ODF format since version 2007, although with several important exceptions, especially in the case of spreadsheets, up to version 2013 \(which supports the reference implementation of ODF 1.2\). Also, if the other party does not have LibreOffice and only needs to read or print the document, this can be exchanged in PDF format \(in this case, using the Hybrid PDF format gives LibreOffice an edge over any other office suite, as the document retains the formatting\).

Of course, choosing the interoperability format for each document might result in an overload and be considered an unnecessary nuisance for the average user, but is a key factor for liberating both the user him/herself and the organization from the constraints of proprietary formats developed by software vendors to perpetuate lock-in. Users and organizations should always remember that closed document formats are limiting not only their freedom but also the ownership of their information assets.
