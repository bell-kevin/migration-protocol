### Starting the Migration Process with the Impact Test

Once the analysis of the existing situation has been completed, it is possible to start the process by implementing an impact test, which is supposed to help find all of the problems that could affect the migration, and ensure that the document workflow works as intended. Although LibreOffice is, to a large extent, fully compatible with MS Office, it is a different application with specific strengths and drawbacks, and might trigger specific workflow issues. The impact test will also allow to estimate the costs of the migration process.

The Impact Test is carried out by installing LibreOffice on a small number of PCs, which represent the average user. In general, they are the tech savvy users, who will also be involved in the project in other ways. They will be, for instance, trained to train their colleagues to use LibreOffice.

The impact test has a couple of key objectives:

* Identifying critical documents, templates and macros: a good deal of existing documents, templates and macros might not be in use, or will have outlived their usefulness after your move to LibreOffice. Documents and templates that are still in use should be converted to the ODF format, while macros should be re-created using the appropriate technology.
* Creating an inventory of tools and MS Office dependent applications, which are quite frequent in CRM and ERP environments. These applications need to be identified and checked for compatibility with LibreOffice, as the new features might offer an alternative solution \(such as CMIS connectivity\). Questionnaires given to team leads or group managers can be used to get a better insight into how the business solutions interact with MS Office.

To minimize support calls and maximize productivity from the start, it is highly advisable to prepare a "welcome" package for users, with supplementary information about LibreOffice, highlighting the basic functionality of the software and the few specific functional differences with MS Office.
