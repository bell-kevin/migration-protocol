### **LibreOffice**

LibreOffice, the leading FOSS office suite for personal productivity in enterprises, offers six feature-rich applications for document production and data processing needs: Writer for text, Calc for spreadsheets, Impress for presentations, Draw for drawings, Base for databases, and Math for mathematical annotations. The program, developed under the stewardship of The Document Foundation \(TDF\), is available for MS Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

LibreOffice uses the ISO standard Open Document Format \(ODF\), recognized by many governments and organizations worldwide - including NATO - and based on true open standards, as the default format for all office documents. ODF files can easily be recognized by their filename extensions: .odt for text files, .ods for spreadsheets, .odp for presentations, .odg for drawings, .odb for databases and .odf for mathematical formulas.

LibreOffice reads and writes several Microsoft proprietary file formats, from the legacy DOC, XLS and PPT to the latest OOXML \(Office Open XML\) pseudo ISO Standard. Since its inception, OOXML has been released in several flavors - 2007 Transitional \(Office 2007\), 2010 Transitional \(Office 2010\), 2013 Transitional and 2013 Strict \(Office 2013\) - with significantly different behaviors.

In addition, LibreOffice allows saving documents in Hybrid PDF format, a standard PDF file which embeds a fully editable ODF document. These documents can be opened by LibreOffice with File &gt; Open just like any other ODF document, and by all other applications as plain PDF files with a double-click on the icon.

LibreOffice also provides shortcuts to send documents as e-mail attachments in all available formats: ODF, PDF \(including Hybrid\) and MS Office formats, including legacy formats.

Finally, LibreOffice installs only free fonts, which are designed to be compatible with every operating system and therefore able to further increase interoperability by helping to maintain the same layout even if the document is accessed on a different OS from the one used to create the original.

Because of these characteristics, LibreOffice is very well suited for organizations of all sizes – both public administrations and private enterprises – planning to migrate from proprietary to FOSS to reduce infrastructure and interoperability costs, and to get rid of vendor lock-in.
