# LibreOffice

LibreOffice is the leading Free Software personal productivity suite for MS Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux, offering six feature-rich applications for all document production and data processing needs: Writer for text, Calc for spreadsheets, Impress for presentations, Draw for drawings, Base for databases, and Math for mathematical annotations. LibreOffice's source code is dual licensed under the LGPLv3/MPL copyleft licenses.

LibreOffice uses the ISO standard Open Document Format \(ODF\), recognized by many governments and organizations worldwide - including NATO - and based on true open standards, as the default format for all office documents. ODF files can easily be recognized by their filename extensions: .odt for text files, .ods for spreadsheets, .odp for presentations, .odg for drawings, .odb for databases and .odf for mathematical formulas.

LibreOffice reads and writes several Microsoft proprietary file formats, from the legacy DOC, XLS and PPT to the latest OOXML \(Office Open XML\) ISO Standard. Since its inception, OOXML has been released in several flavors - 2007 Transitional \(Office 2007\), 2010 Transitional \(Office 2010\), 2013 Transitional and 2013 Strict \(Office 2013\) - with significantly different behaviors.

In addition, LibreOffice allows saving documents in Hybrid PDF format, a standard PDF file which embeds a fully editable ODF document. These documents can be opened by LibreOffice with File &gt; Open just like any other ODF document, and by all other applications as plain PDF files with a double-click on the icon.

LibreOffice also provides shortcuts to send documents as e-mail attachments in all available formats: ODF, PDF \(including Hybrid\) and MS Office formats, including legacy formats.

Finally, LibreOffice installs only free fonts, which are designed to be compatible with every operating system and therefore able to further increase interoperability by helping to maintain the same layout even if the document is accessed on a different OS from the one used to create the original.

# Migrating to LibreOffice

The office suite is an integral component of any workflow, either personal or organizational, and as such is essential for the productivity of most personal computer users. LibreOffice is a viable replacement for Microsoft Office, and can significantly reduce the Total Cost of Ownership of enterprise PCs because it replaces the license cost with a substantially lower migration cost.

Migrating to LibreOffice can become a complex endeavor for organizations because of the underlying problems represented by the resistance to change - inherent in group dynamics - and by the integration of the office suite in the IT infrastructure \(encompassing third party proprietary software, and the conversion of document templates and macros\).

On the other hand, the migration to LibreOffice represents an excellent opportunity to rethink the organization's processes. For example, before migrating any existing Visual Basic macros, it is better to determine if the macros are still needed, in order to discard those that are no longer used, and re-engineer the remaining ones. The same applies to document templates, and to proprietary plugins which connect the office suite to proprietary enterprise applications.

On that note, LibreOffice 4.0 significantly reduced the necessity of these plugins thanks to CMIS \(Content Management Interoperability Services\) support, an open standard that allows several content management systems such as MS SharePoint, IBM FileNet, Alfresco and Nuxeo to interoperate over the Internet with compatible client applications, which can browse, read and modify contents.

# LibreOffice Migration Protocol

The protocol represents a reference for migrations, based on the best practices from some of the most successful projects \(such as the city of Munich in Germany and the city of Bologna in Italy, and Regione Umbria in Italy\).

# Lessons learned from successful migrations

LibreOffice's feature set is more than adequate for the everyday needs of the majority - i.e. more than 90% - of users inside organizations of any size. In general, the few technical obstacles are related to spreadsheets using advanced features or to MS Office macros, which are often difficult to migrate for a number of reasons.

Users should be able to produce documents using LibreOffice right after the training: therefore, it is crucial to complete the setup and the test of the workstations before training begins, as any delay in the installation of LibreOffice will diminish the effect of the training itself. It is also extremely important to offer a reference point for any problem connected to the migration, starting from "technology leaders" up to trained support personnel.

In fact, the production of the first few documents will create a lasting perception about the quality of LibreOffice in the mind of the users: a smooth process will motivate them to continue and try new more advanced features, while stumbling into a problem - even a trivial one - will discourage them and leave a negative feeling.

The biggest problem, then, is the resistance to change, which is a side effect of the introduction of a new technology in any large organization. This it often seen as a burden in addition to everyday work, and has to be tackled with a carefully crafted communication strategy. Users have to be persuaded that the new tools, after some training, can provide a better and more rewarding user experience.

Typical reasons for resistance to change are:

    • The fear of the unknown, which triggers the fear of not being good enough to deal with the new technology;

    • The perception that the change is being imposed by the top management, which is not using the new tool to the same extent as middle managers and employees;

    • A poor communication strategy: when it comes to a change management process there's no such thing as too much communication;

    • A change of routine, which translates into a change - or perceived reduction - of the user's comfort zone;

    • A low trust in the organization's, management's or personal capability to competently manage the change;

    • A misunderstanding about the need for a change, especially from those who strongly believe that the current way of doing things works well... and has done so for twenty years!

    • A change in the status quo, which triggers the perception that at the end of the process one's situation will be worse than before \(because the change favours another group, such as younger people in the case of old loyal employees\).

Of course, the "brute force" method - which consists in installing LibreOffice and eradicating MS Office without any previous warning - is the worst of all choices, as it creates a rejection effect which kills any hope of success.

# Migration, Step by Step

### Communicating the change

In order to reduce the impact of resistance to change, it is important to start the migration project with a communication activity targeted at the entire organization \(and not only to future users of LibreOffice\). In fact, migrating to LibreOffice is a strategic move for the organization, and should be communicated with the same emphasis as any other strategic decision.

When the migration process starts, all managers and employees should be familiar with the rationale behind the decision to migrate to LibreOffice \(lower TCO and independence from vendor lock-in\), and with LibreOffice \(history of the project, software features, potential interoperability issues, and so on\). It should be clear for everyone that LibreOffice is a viable replacement for Microsoft Office, which has already been implemented on million of desktops worldwide.

### Starting the migration process

Once the analysis of the existing situation \(in terms of third party applications, templates and macros to migrate\) has been completed, it is possible to start the process by implementing an impact test, which is supposed to help find all of the problems that could affect the migration, and ensure that document workflow and interoperability work as intended. Although LibreOffice is, to a very large extent, fully compatible with MS Office, it is a different application with specific strengths and drawbacks, and might trigger specific workflow and interoperability issues.

The participants to the impact test should be representative of the entire organization workflow, and should be trained on LibreOffice \(or have access to trained personnel\).

The impact test has a couple of key objectives:

    • Identifying critical documents, templates and macros: a good deal of existing documents, templates and macros might not be in use, or will have outlived their usefulness after your move to LibreOffice. Documents and templates that are still in use should be converted to the standard ODF format, while macros should be re-created using the appropriate technology.

    • Creating an inventory of tools and MS Office dependent applications, which are quite frequent in CRM and ERP environments. These applications need to be identified and checked for compatibility with LibreOffice, as the new features might offer an alternative solution \(such as CMIS connectivity\). Questionnaires given to team leads or group managers can be used to get a better insight into how the business solutions interact with MS Office.

To minimize support calls and maximize productivity from the start, it is highly advisable to prepare a "welcome" package for users, with supplementary information about LibreOffice, highlighting the basic functionality of the software and the few specific functional differences with MS Office.

### Switching to open document standards

It is also important to switch immediately to the standard ODF format for all documents, and resort to legacy or current MS Office document formats only to exchange files with users of the proprietary office suite. File sharing is a crucial issue, because it is essential to be able to develop and exchange information effectively. Using ODF as the default document format helps organizations to establish a repository for all information assets, guaranteed against obsolescence and vendor lock-in.

In addition, MS Office is able to read and write ODF format since version 2007, although with several important exceptions, especially in the case of spreadsheets, up to version 2013 \(which supports the reference implementation of ODF 1.2\). Also, if the other party does not have LibreOffice and only needs to read or print the document, this can be exchanged in PDF format \(in this case, using the Hybrid PDF format gives LibreOffice an edge over any other office suite, as the document retains the formatting\).

Of course, choosing the interoperability format for each document might result in an overload and be considered an unnecessary nuisance for the average user, but is a key factor for liberating both the user him/herself and the organization from the constraints of proprietary formats developed by software vendors to perpetuate lock-in. Users and organizations should always remember that closed document formats are limiting not only their freedom but also the ownership of their information assets.

### Identifying "technology leaders" within the organization

Once the impact test and the migration to ODF are in place, it is the right time to identify "technology leaders" within the organization: they are the individuals who are recognized by their peers for their tech competence. For instance, they are the ones who are asked about the latest and greatest smartphone or PC to buy, and about the sexiest applications to use.

"Technology leaders" will have a key role in the migration process, as they will become the LibreOffice evangelists and act as the first contact point for providing simple support to users. The role and efforts of the "technology leaders" should be recognized, supported and encouraged through appropriate incentives by the organization's management.

Once the "technology leaders" have been identified, it will be necessary to organize a small number of LibreOffice briefing sessions targeted mainly at senior and middle management, the IT Support team and the "technology leaders". The briefings are intended to achieve the required buy-in of LibreOffice and motivate the decision makers and the opinion leaders about the migration process.

Once the key stakeholders are convinced, they will be able to inform their staff about the migration process and to encourage them to adopt LibreOffice as early as possible after training and installation.

The first group of "technology leaders" should include - if possible - a mix of middle managers and employees in order to penetrate into the different layers of the organization. The group will meet regularly during all the stages of the migration process, to share the different experiences and identify solutions to common issues.

### Providing training and support

A comprehensive training on LibreOffice - characteristics, advantages, features, peculiarities, and main differences with MS Office - is a fundamental step for any migration project. Training, at different levels, should be provided to IT personnel, trainers, "technology leaders", middle and upper management, and all end users.

Another objective of the training process is to make users aware of the rationale and objectives of the migration project, so that it is not perceived as a mere solution to budget-related issues. In fact, migrating to LibreOffice offers the opportunity of adopting a truly open and standard format, intended to protect the freedom of each individual's creative work and contribute to the growth of a Free Software project which is beneficial to the user community at large \(beyond any kind of border\).

Users, including middle and upper managers, should be segmented for technical skills, training needs and organizational units. These groups form the basis for planning the implementation phase of the migration, so that the transition takes place in homogeneous steps \(to avoid fragmentation\).

Trainings will also be instrumental for the development of a technical support team, which is another crucial element for the success of the migration project. In fact, when the "technology leaders" - who  provide first-hand support to colleagues - are not able to provide an answer to issues arising within their department, the problem should always be escalated to first level support and if necessary to second level support \(which might be internal or external, according to needs\).

In order to assist users, the entire support team will work together to compile a list of Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQ\) as a quick reference for future needs. This FAQ, together will all the documents used during the migration process - especially presentations and manuals - should be published online onto the organization's website, for easy access and retrieval.

### Deploying LibreOffice on every personal computer

The deployment of LibreOffice on every personal computer, including those of users who have been authorized - for specific technical reasons - to keep on using MS Office, needs to be planned in advance and should be coordinated with the training schedule, in order to ensure that users will be able to use the software as soon as possible \(ideally, after the first training session\).

The deployment method can be identified and selected based on the characteristics of the organization's IT infrastructure. LibreOffice can be mass-deployed inside a large organization using Windows desktops by tweaking the .msi package with the help of a MSI editor such as InstEd, and then by creating a Group Policy Object \(GPO\) to distribute the software package.

Deploying LibreOffice, though, does not mean eradicating MS Office from each and every PC. The goal is to maximize the number of PCs using LibreOffice, and to foster the interoperability with MS Office by identifying areas where the latter - for obvious reasons - tries to perpetuate lock-in. For instance, it will be necessary to educate MS Office users - who, at the end of the migration, should not exceed 20% of all users \(as this is the highest potential percentage of people using MS Office-specific features in corporate environments\) - to replace proprietary fonts with free fonts \(such as those backed by the SIL Open Font License\).
