### Training Users

A comprehensive training on LibreOffice - characteristics, advantages, features, peculiarities, and main differences with MS Office - is a fundamental step for any migration project. Training, at different levels, should be provided to IT personnel, trainers, "technology leaders", middle and upper management, and all end users.

Another objective of the training process is to make users aware of the rationale and objectives of the migration project, so that it is not perceived as a mere solution to budget-related issues. In fact, migrating to LibreOffice offers the opportunity of adopting a truly open and standard format, intended to protect the freedom of each individual's creative work and contribute to the growth of a Free Software project which is beneficial to the user community at large \(beyond any kind of border\).

Users, including middle and upper managers, should be segmented for technical skills, training needs and organizational units. These groups form the basis for planning the implementation phase of the migration, so that the transition takes place in homogeneous steps \(to avoid fragmentation\).

Trainings will also be instrumental for the development of a technical support team, which is another crucial element for the success of the migration project. In fact, when the "technology leaders" - who  provide first-hand support to colleagues - are not able to provide an answer to issues arising within their department, the problem should always be escalated to first level support and if necessary to second level support \(which might be internal or external, according to needs\).
