#### User Support

Support is a critical factor for the success of a migration project, as with it the users do not feel abandoned in front of the new productivity tool. In fact, although the features are identical or extremely similar to Microsoft Office, they are often organized in a different way \(and this is usually more than enough to get a negative reaction from users\).

Enterprise support of LibreOffice is usually organized internally, with a mix of IT people and tech savvy users who can provide Level 1 and Level 2 support to end users. Level 3 support, on the contrary, is based on development related skills and should therefore be managed by an external structure with certified developers capable of solving bugs.

In fact, bugs are intrinsic of any software development \(even the most expensive proprietary software\). So, the availability of contracted support to address potential software code issues is vital for the deployment of LibreOffice in a corporate environment, also because all relevant patches are usually merged upstream with the community version of LibreOffice.

In order to assist enterprise users, the entire support team will also work at a list of Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQ\) as a quick reference for future needs. This FAQ, together will all the documents used during the migration process – especially presentations and manuals – should be published online onto the organization website, for easy access and retrieval by users.
