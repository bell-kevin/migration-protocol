#### Communicating the change

In order to reduce the impact of resistance to change, it is important to start the migration project with a communication activity targeted at the entire organization \(and not only to future users of LibreOffice\). In fact, migrating to LibreOffice is a strategic move for the organization, and should be communicated with the same emphasis as any other strategic decision.

When the migration process starts, all managers and employees should be familiar with the rationale behind the decision to migrate to LibreOffice \(lower TCO and independence from vendor lock-in\), and with LibreOffice \(history of the project, software features, potential interoperability issues, and so on\). It should be clear for everyone that LibreOffice is a viable replacement for Microsoft Office, which has already been implemented on million of desktops worldwide.
