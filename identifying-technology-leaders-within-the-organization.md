### Identifying "technology leaders" within the organization

Once the impact test and the migration to ODF are in place, it is the right time to identify "technology leaders" within the organization: they are the individuals who are recognized by their peers for their tech competence. For instance, they are the ones who are asked about the latest and greatest smartphone or PC to buy, and about the sexiest applications to use.

"Technology leaders" will have a key role in the migration process, as they will become the LibreOffice evangelists and act as the first contact point for providing simple support to users. The role and efforts of the "technology leaders" should be recognized, supported and encouraged through appropriate incentives by the organization's management.

Once the "technology leaders" have been identified, it will be necessary to organize a small number of LibreOffice briefing sessions targeted mainly at senior and middle management, the IT Support team and the "technology leaders". The briefings are intended to achieve the required buy-in of LibreOffice and motivate the decision makers and the opinion leaders about the migration process.

Once the key stakeholders are convinced, they will be able to inform their staff about the migration process and to encourage them to adopt LibreOffice as early as possible after training and installation.

The first group of "technology leaders" should include - if possible - a mix of middle managers and employees in order to penetrate into the different layers of the organization. The group will meet regularly during all the stages of the migration process, to share the different experiences and identify solutions to common issues.
